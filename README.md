# simple-browser-calc
Simple browser calculator from scratch.

As of 1/16/2019 this project is incomplete. Basic functionality in place, and calculator will correctly perform the
supplied operations, and will allow the user to evaluate successive operations without clearing the 'memory' of the
calculator so long as the user explicitly chooses the next operator and specifies a new operand.
